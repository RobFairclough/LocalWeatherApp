This is a local weather app, built as a project for FreeCodeCamp.

This was written with HTML, CSS and JS using Bootstrap, Animate.CSS and JQuery.

It makes use of an API provided by FreeCodeCamp, calls the API using the geolocation provided by the user's browser.
If the location is provided, the API is called using that, and returns weather data about the user's local area.
The page is then updated to display this data, and the background image is updated to reflect.
There's also a button which uses a simple JS algorithm to convert the provided temperature between Celcius and Fahrenheit.
